# IoT-Based-Air-Quality-Index-Monitoring-System
Since better air quality is very much important for healthy environment. Therefore, to control the air pollution an accurate monitoring of the air quality is very much important. So, a good air quality monitoring system can help us to aware the public as well as can give recommendations to the policy makers to provide guidelines to industrialists and to the public. The proposed project “Real Time IoT Based Air Quality Monitoring System” is just about the analysis of air quality on the basis of the data acquired by the help of different gas, particulate matter, humidity and temperature sensors. The sensors will be interfaced with the microcontroller to achieve the data of some dangerous air pollutants like Carbon Monoxide(CO), Carbon Dioxide(CO2), Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2), Sulphur Dioxide(SO2) and Particulate Matter(PM) along with Humidity and Temperature in the air.
